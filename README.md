# maze_solver_a_star_classroom_assignment
Assignment for students learning graph search algorithms such as A*.  This assignment is inspired by the Pacman assignments used in [CS 188: Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.berkeley.edu/home.html), taught by Drs. Dan Klein and Pieter Abeel at University of California, Berkeley.

A random 20x20 Maze object is created and passed to pathfinder.get_directions(), which the student must implement.
The function should return a list of directions to take in sequence, where each direction is "u", "d", "l", or "r".

The student's path through the maze is then visualized using tkinter.

The Maze object contains some useful functions to help the student identify legal moves, identify a winning space in the maze, etc.
