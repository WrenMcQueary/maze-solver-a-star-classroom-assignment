    Useful note: maze.grid is the numpy grid representation of the maze.  Also, maze has several functions that might
    be useful.  Feel free to use of its methods, except the ones that
    start with underscores.  Also, util.MinPriorityQueue is a useful class for enqueueing the nodes you discover.
